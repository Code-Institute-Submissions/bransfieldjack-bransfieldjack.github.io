# Stream One: Front End Project

## About

This project has been re-deployed to this repository. For earlier attempts/work, please see the original deployment at this location:

https://github.com/bransfieldjack/StreamOneProject-master

This is a portfolio site for a well known artist from Cork City, Chris O'Shea. Chris is the owner of Pebble Lyrics, a locally based art company specialising in unique, custom, hand-made pebble pictures. 
All of the materials are sourced locally and from renewable materials where possible. 
The purpose of the site is to showcase Chris' work. 
For this site, we agreed that the single scrolling page layout would be most approriate. 
This approach allowed for a more structured flow of information being recived from the site by the user. 
The single scrolling site is also great for mobile use, however excessive scrolling was one problem I encountered. 
To mitigate this, I have added seperate HTML pages where necessary. (Contact form & Portfolio etc.)
